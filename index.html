        Damodar Savarkar (28 May 1883 to 26 Feb 1966) was a fearless freedom
        fighter, social reformer, writer, dramatist, historian, political leader
        and philosopher. Savarkar’s thoughts touch upon virtually every aspect
        of nation-building and are relevant even today. Unfortunately, Savarkar
        has been a victim of malice and misinformation. As a considerable part
        of his literature is in Marathi, his thoughts and achievements in
        several spheres are largely unknown outside Maharashtra.</h2>
